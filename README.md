# OSE - Orientation to Software Engineering Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences (Helsinki, Finland)
### This repo has all the little codes from Software Engineering course at Haaga-Helia. The course was an intro-level course that covered JavaScript. It was enjoyable to write little js codes that do some stuff. We never went that deep, but it was still enjoyable to make little web-pages that would do simple scripts like roll the dice for all those gambling projects us IT people will be doing in the workforce soon (:). I would be seriously surprised if anybody would figure out how to use github and search to find these codes in future semesters.  In the course, the content ran out of steam a little bit past the half-way mark, but it's a university and the ministry of magical education dictates that we must attend lecture even if it's only to listen to our teacher ramble on the same example of json stringify(), pop() and push() for 5 weeks over and over.
