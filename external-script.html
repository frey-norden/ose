<!--
1) How does the page look now?
    The page displays the code in the <code> tag with css styling.
2) Any difference from before?
    Yes, before nothing was displayed on the scene. I had to view source to get the code template.
3) What did the external JavaScript do?
    The external JavaScript is delivered from the content delivery network found at the url inside the <script> tag.
